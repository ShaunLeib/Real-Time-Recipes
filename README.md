# Real-Time-Recipes
Discover recipes to make based on the ingredients you own

Description:
As a group project with three other students, we made a web app that allows clients to input ingredients and the server
will output recipes. These recipes contain the ingredients that the user entered
with 75% matching. Additionally, the user can
use filters (diets, cuisines, meal type, cost, cook time, etc) which wil filter out
recipes. Finally, the user can enter their own recipes.

What I learned:
With the creation of this project, I learned a deeper understanding of both client and server side node.js and express with handlebars.
Additionally, working as a team on a project using github to document changes.
